- **Diverse Payment Options**: Purchase via cash in-store, credit card or bank transfer, each with clear fee structures.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Integrating Retail Barcode Workflow**:

Challenge: Building a reliable barcode-based payment flow between retailers and blockchain transactions posed integration and real-time verification hurdles.

Resolution: Created a robust API ecosystem linking POS systems to our backend, added real-time transaction status updates, and established redundancy protocols to ensure seamless payments even under load.

- **Balancing Speed with Compliance (KYC & AML)**:

Challenge: Users expected a fast, cash-like experience, but regulatory compliance required KYC/AML checks that could slow onboarding.

Resolution: Implemented streamlined KYC flows with tiered verification: basic KYC for smaller transactions processed instantly, and progressive steps for higher-value users, maintaining both legality and user convenience.
