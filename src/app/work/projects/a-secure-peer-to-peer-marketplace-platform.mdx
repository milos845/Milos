## Overview

Maketrade is a Finnish platform designed to make buying and selling used goods online as safe and reliable as purchasing new items. By providing escrow-managed payments, in-app user verification, and seller ratings, Maketrade minimizes fraud and builds trust in peer-to-peer trades.

## Key Features

- **Escrow Payment System**: Payments are held in trust via Mangopay until both buyer and seller confirm completion, safeguarding both sides.
- **Strong KYC Verification**: Users undergo verified identity checks before transacting, adding a layer of trust and reducing fraud.
- **Peer Ratings & Reputation**: After every trade, participants rate each other—creating transparent reputational profiles.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Mobile-responsive UI guides users through listing items, making offers, and completing transactions effortlessly.
- **Tailored for Circular Economy**: The platform’s mission is to promote sustainable consumption by making secondhand trade reliable and user-friendly.

## Challenging Problems & Resolutions

- **Escrow Integration Across POS & Web**:

Challenge: Ensuring that payments are securely held and released only after successful delivery required seamless API integration with Mangopay and dependable real-time status updates.

Resolution: We built redundant webhooks, real-time trade status tracking, and fallback mechanisms—ensuring funds remain secure, even amid network issues.

- **Balancing Speed with Compliance**:

Challenge: Users expected quick, peer-like exchanges, but regulatory requirements (KYC, escrow, GDPR) introduced complexity and friction.

Resolution: We implemented tiered verification—instant account setup for low-value trades, with progressively stricter checks for higher-value transactions—maintaining legal compliance without impeding usability
