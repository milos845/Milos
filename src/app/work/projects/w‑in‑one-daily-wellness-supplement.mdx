## Challenging Problems & Resolutions

- **Communicating Complex Formulations Simply**:

Challenge: Condensing information from a 40+ ingredient complex into easy-to-understand messaging without overwhelming users.

Resolution: We distilled content into structured benefit categories (energy, sleep, digestion, etc.), used iconography, and layered FAQ design to reveal details progressively—keeping the interface clean yet informative.

- **Balancing Transparency and Regulatory Compliance**:

Challenge: Displaying ingredient specifics and health claims while remaining compliant with EU regulations for dietary supplements.

Resolution: We collaborated with regulatory experts to craft compliant claims, implemented clear labeling and ingredient sourcing info, and used Shopify’s CMS to host a privacy/legal section and compliant product labels.
