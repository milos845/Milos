## Overview

It enables large online retailers—especially in the D‑A‑CH region and the Netherlands—to offer flexible payment methods (open invoice, instalments, direct debit) under their own brand, while Ratepay assumes all risk and handles the entire payment lifecycle.

## Key Features

- **White‑Label Integration**: Fully branded checkout experience—buyers stay within the merchant’s site without redirection, boosting trust and reducing cart abandonment
- **Multi‑Method Payment Options**: Supports the most popular payment types in the region: open invoice, instalments (including 0 % financing), and SEPA direct debit—driving higher conversion and larger baskets
- **Risk & Fraud Management**: Ratepay absorbs full credit and fraud risk via real‑time scoring and default coverage—guaranteeing merchants receive 100 % payouts
- **Flexible Modular System**: Merchants tailor pricing, interest, payout timing, late‑fee intervals, and messaging language (e.g., invoice reminders)—all configurable to business needs
- **Reseller & PSP Model**: Payment service providers and marketplaces can integrate Ratepay once and offer BNPL options to all merchants under a single contract—complete with reconciliation and risk coverage

## Challenging Problems & Resolutions

- **Maintaining Brand Continuity vs. Handling Risk**:

Challenge: Building a white‑label system that preserves merchant branding while Ratepay internalizes all payment risk and fraud.

Resolution: We architected a seamless front‑end checkout experience branded to each merchant, backed by Ratepay’s invisible risk engine handling real‑time scoring, claims acquisition, and payout—protecting merchants while preserving their UX 

- **Supporting PSP/Marketplace Scale and Integration**:

Challenge: Enabling PSPs and marketplaces to onboard numerous merchants easily, with a single integration covering all BNPL methods.

Resolution: We created a modular reseller model with a one‑time API integration, consolidated contract and reconciliation, 100 % payout assurance, and scalable onboarding—empowering partners like PayPal, eBay, Adyen, Metro, and OTTO
